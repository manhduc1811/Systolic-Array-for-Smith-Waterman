# Systolic Array for Smith-Waterman
This work implements the Smith-Waterman, a dynamic programming algorithm for performing local sequence alignment. The process can be accelerated through parallelism.  
An architecture called systolic array was implemented to realize parallel computing, resulting the complexity to drop from O(mn) to O(m+n) where m and n is the length of reference genome and short read.By doing so, we decrease the execution time sharply.  
Still, the amount of PEs is limited so we need to divide the similarity matrix into sub- matrices and finish the calculation in several iteration,resulting a fall in performance.

## Usage
### Software Simulation : 
1. To run one read, simply execute the “demo” program, by typing ./demo in the command line.
The result will be saved in anser.csv in the dat folder.
2. To execute many read, execute the “GoldenDataGenerator”  
This program will automatically read in all the data saved in in_1.dat and convert them into encoded file and save in BinaryInput.dat in the dat folder.  
If you want to test your own DNA sequences, change the contents in in_1.dat .   
3. To change the scoring criteria of goldenDataGenerator, open Golden.cpp and change line14 ~ line17.  
After that, type: _g++ -o goldenDataGenerator -O3 generator.cpp Golden.cpp_ to compile. 
4. To change the scoring criteria of demo, open algorithm.cpp and c change line13 ~ line16.   
After that, type: _g++ -o demo -O3 algorithm.cpp_ to compile. 
### Hardware Simulation:
The hardware was simulated using ncverilog, and APR done by Innovus, using TSMC 130nm technology.  
1. The RTL simulation can be done by typing:  
_ncverilog testfixture.v core.v +notimingchecks_
2. The APR level simulation can be done by typing:  
_ncverilog -f run_APR.f_  
Note that you need to open systolic.v and disable “ \`include sram_1024x8_t13.v” first. 

## Block Diagram
### Architecture
![Block_diagram](https://github.com/jasonlin316/Systolic-Array-for-Smith-Waterman/blob/master/pic/block_diagram.png)
Since the number of PEs is limited, we need to divide the matrix into sub-matrices to calculate the similarity matrix. In each iteration, the PE array will calculate one sub-matrix, and store the intermediate results in SRAM for the next iteration to use. Both the reference and short read is read in through serial in.

The input comes from the last stage of PE, receiveing V and F. The E value is stored in the E-out registerand passed to the next cycle as this PE will be used to calculated the next read.  
In the end, three value was compared and the biggest of all will be stored in the max-out and passed to the next PE.
